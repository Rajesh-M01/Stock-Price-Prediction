# Stock-Price-Prediction-LSTM
This project implements a LSTM hybrid model for time series forecasting to predict stock prices. The model leverages LSTM for sequential learning, making it more effective for analyzing stock trends and understanding about the market better.

Dataset :
Used Tesla stock price dataset(tesla-stock-price.csv).
Data sourced from Kaggle.

Model Overview :
Preprocessing: Min-Max Scaling for normalization.

Architecture:
CNN Layer: Extracts spatial features.
LSTM Layer: Captures sequential patterns.
Dense Layers: Outputs the final stock price predictions.
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Optimizer: Adam.

Results:
Below is the comparison of actual vs. predicted stock prices:
